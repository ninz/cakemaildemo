### Cake Mail Request

A sample HTTP request parser written for Cake Mail as a code test

### Usage

To run the demo:

	./Demo.php

### Addendum

Ideally this little app would use namespaces instead of an include statement, and would also have much more robust validation of the HTTP request. Minimal validation was included to show that I know how to do it and use Exceptions.
